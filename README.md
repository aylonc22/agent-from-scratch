# agent-from-scratch

This is my personal workspace for following along with the **"Build an AI Agent from Scratch"** workshop by [Scott Moss (Hendrixer)](https://github.com/Hendrixer).

I'm using this repo to write, experiment, and explore independently instead of directly cloning or forking the original.

## ðŸ§  Workshop Overview

The workshop teaches how to build an intelligent AI agent using TypeScript and OpenAI's API, focusing on prompt chaining, memory, and reasoning systems.

> ðŸ”— **Official course**: [Watch on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/agent-from-scratch/)

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

This project requires **Node.js v20+** or **Bun v1.0.20**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-from-scratch.git
